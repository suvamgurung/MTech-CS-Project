# A Framework to Build Knowledge Grpah from Unstructured Data
## Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY)

In this project, I have attempted to build a framework to fill the gap between unstructured source of data and creation of Knowledge Graph with domain specific NLP Model as the bridge. The Knowledge Graph thus built is visualised using Neo4j platform. This entire project is a step-by-step procedure to build the above mentioned framework accomplished using Google Colaboratory. Python libraries like Apache Tika, SpaCy, OpenAI, Pandas and Regular Expressions along with Cypher Query Language and Neo4j Software have been utilised to realise the proposed framework.

The main highlight of this project is the development of a domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) component trained using spaCy which aids the generation of Knowledge Graph for a social security scheme such as AB-PMJAY. Such a framework for a social security scheme is quite unique. We have focused on the creation of Knowledge Graph for the general process flow of AB-PMJAY scheme with respect to different stakeholders.The knowledge graph thus created will show the comprehensiveness of process flow of PMJAY as a visual composition of nodes and relationships infused with properties that can be queried by different stakeholders as per their interest.
