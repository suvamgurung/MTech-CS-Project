PM-JAY primarily targets the poor, \n","deprived rural families and identified occupational categories of urban workers families as per the \n","SECC (Socio-Economic Caste Census) 2011 database. In addition, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana \n","(RSBY) active card holders can also avail PM-JAY benefits. \n"," \n","There is no cap on family size and age as well as no restriction on pre-existing conditions for entitled \n","families.
