The training process consists of iterating over the training data n_iter times, shuffling the data at the beginning of each epoch. For each epoch, the training data is divided into batches using the minibatch function, which takes a sequence of examples and returns a sequence of batches, where each batch contains a variable number of examples. The size of each batch is increased exponentially with each iteration of the loop, starting at 4 and capped at 32. (e.g., (1,32,2) -> batch size would be:- 1,2,4,8,16,32.)\n","\n","During each iteration of the inner loop over the batches, the code extracts the text and the annotations from each example in the batch using the zip function. For each text in the batch, two Spacy Doc objects are created, one for each NER model, using the make_doc function. Then, two Example objects are created from each Doc and its corresponding annotations using the Example.from_dict method. Finally, the update method of each NER model is called with its corresponding Example object, the sgd optimizer, a dropout rate of 0.35, and an empty dictionary for storing the loss values.\n","\n","At the end of each epoch, the loss values for each NER model are printed.
